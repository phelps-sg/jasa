example of a trivial network model, and the JinGirNew network model
(repast/demo/jinGirNew) is a more complicated and realistic example.

<b>Network Overview</b><br>
Network models in Repast are built around two basic 
interfaces: the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/Node.html">Node</a> and the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/Edge.html">Edge</a>. All
the mechanisms for displaying, exporting and importing networks use
these two interfaces and they should be the basis for your own
network models. Repast provides default implementations of these
interfaces,
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultNode.html">DefaultNode</a>
and
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultEdge.html">DefaultEdge</a>
that can be used as is or as the basis for your own network node and
edge classes.<p>

The Node and Edge interfaces provide some simple methods for
working with network nodes and edges. The API documentation should
be clear, but the intention is that a Node keeps track of its
incoming and outgoing edges as well as an optional label while
an Edge keeps track of the Nodes to which and from which it is
joined. In addition, an Edge also has methods for getting and
setting the strength of the edge (typically to a value of 1), as 
well as an optional label and type. The type of the edge 
refers to the type of network that the edge defines (e.g.
kinship, business and so forth).<p>

Creating a link (an Edge) between two Nodes can be done
is either of two ways. The first way:
<code><pre>
// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode("A");
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode("B");

// constructs a DefaultEdge from nodeA to nodeB
// with a default strength of 1
// nodeA --> nodeB
DefaultEdge edge = new DefaultEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
nodeA.addOutEdge(edge);
nodeB.addInEdge(edge);
</pre></code>

Here two Nodes are created, and Edge is created linking nodeA to
nodeB. This Edge is then added as an outgoing Edge to nodeA and as an
incoming Edge to nodeB.<p>

The second and preferrable way is to use the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/EdgeFactory.html">EdgeFactory</a>
class to automate edge creation and linking for you. For example,
<code><pre>
// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode("A");
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode("B");

// creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA to nodeB
EdgeFactory.createEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
</pre></code>
Here EdgeFactory creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA and nodeB
appropriately. EdgeFactory also as methods for setting edge strength
labels and so forth during edge creation. In addition, you can also
supply your own Edge implementing classes and EdgeFactory can use
those. For example,

<code><pre>
// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode("A");
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode("B");

// creates a DefaultEdge and links nodeA to nodeB
EdgeFactory.linkNodes(nodeA, nodeB, new MyEdge());
</pre></code>
Here, EdgeFactory will link nodeA to nodeB using MyEdge. See the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/EdgeFactory.html">API</a> docs
for EdgeFactory for more info.<p>


A Node can get a reference to another Node via the Edge
that connects them. For example,
<code><pre>
// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode("A");
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode("B");

EdgeFactory.createEdge(nodeA, nodeB);

// set up is complete. The following shows
// how to get a reference to nodeB given only
// nodeA.

ArrayList outEdges = nodeA.getOutEdges();

// we know there is only a single edge from nodeA
// because we only added one. Typically you'd 
// iterate through or choose a specific edge based
// on some criteria.
DefaultEdge someEdge = (DefaultEdge)outEdges.get(0);

// the getToNode() method returns a Node so we need to
// cast to a DefaultNode. This someNode is in fact 
// nodeB.
DefaultNode someNode = (DefaultNode)someEdge.getToNode();

// label = "B"
String label = someNode.getLabel();
</pre></code>

DefaultNode also provides many convenience methods that makes 
coding something like the above a bit shorter. See DefaultNode's
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultNode.html">API</a>
docs for the details. For example,

<code><pre>
// this sets up the Nodes
DefaultNode nodeA = new DefaultNode("A");
DefaultNode nodeB = new DefaultNode("B");

// constructs a DefaultEdge from nodeA to nodeB
// with a default strength of 1
// nodeA --> nodeB
DefaultEdge edge = new DefaultEdge(nodeA, nodeB);
nodeA.addOutEdge(edge);
nodeB.addInEdge(edge);

// set up is complete. The following shows
// how to get a reference to nodeB given only
// nodeA.

// we know there is only a single edge from nodeA
// because we only added one, and thus only a single
// ToNode.

DefaultNode = (DefaultNode)nodeA.getToNodes().get(0);

// label = "B"
String label = someNode.getLabel();
</pre></code>

Here the getToNodes() methods allows us to remove some of the code
from the first example. DefaultNode contains many such methods.<p>

The DefaultNode provides much of the network type functionality you
are likely to need. Consequently, you can compose your own network
agents out of these DefaultNodes, either by inheritance or
composition.<p>

A typical network model will treat the network nodes as the agents,
and build these nodes and any necessary Edges as part of the
buildModel() template method. For example,

<code><pre>
public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  ArrayList agentList = new ArrayList();

  ...

  private void buildModel() {
    // creates DefaultNodes and adds them to a list
    for (int i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {
      DefaultNode node = new DefaultNode(String.valueOf(i));
      agentList.add(node);
    }

    // iterate through the agentList creating edges between 
    // the current node and the previous node. 
    for (int i = 0; i < agentList.size(); i++) {
      Node node = (Node)agentList.get(i);
      Node prevNode = null;
      if (i == 0) {
        // current node is first node in list so
        // create an edge between it and the last node in
        // the list.
	prevNode = (Node)agentList.get(agentList.size() - 1);
      } else {
        prevNode = (Node)agentList.get(i - 1);
      }
      
      EdgeFactory.createEdge(node, prevNode);
    }
  }
}
</pre></code>

This is a simple example of how the structure of the initial network
is created (adding edges to previous nodes). Real network models will
use the same sort of code to create and add edges, but the criterion
for adding edges will certainly be different. Together the Nodes and
their Edges constitute the network, and all the nodes are placed in an
ArrayList. Consequently this ArrayList represents the network as a
whole. Many methods in the 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetUtilities.html">NetUtilities</a>
class operate on the entire network and expect to get such an ArrayList of 
nodes as an argument.<p>


<a name="display">
<b>Displaying Networks</b><br>
Repast provides some fairly useful tools for network visualization. However,
these tools are meant only to give you sense of the network and are not
intended for network analysis. True network visualization and analysis
should be done with third party tools such as Pajek or UCINet.<p>

Networks are displayed using the 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/Network2DDisplay.html">Network2DDisplay</a> class.
The Network2DDisplay class expects to be drawing a network composed of 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DrawableNonGridNode.html">DrawableNonGridNodes</a>
and
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DrawableEdge.html">DrawableEdges</a>.
As mentioned above, this network is encapsulated by a List of Nodes,
in this case, DrawableNonGridNodes whose edges are of the DrawableEdge
type.  Typically, this List is not passed directly to the
Network2DDisplay for drawing, but is wrapped in some sort of
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/GraphLayout.html">GraphLayout</a> first.
The GraphLayout sets the x and y coordinates of the DrawableNonGridNodes 
according to some algorithm and then the Network2DDisplay displays the
nodes at these coordinates. Repast comes with four types of GraphLayouts:
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/CircularGraphLayout.html">CircularGraphLayout</a>,
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/RandomGraphLayout.html">RandomGraphLayout</a>,
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/FruchGraphLayout.html">FruchGraphLayout</a>
 (lays out the nodes according to a modified implementation of the 
Fruchmen-Reingold graph layout algorithm), and
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/KamadaGraphLayout.html">KamadaGraphLayout</a>
 (lays out the nodes according to a modified implementation of the
Kamada Kawai graph layout algorithm). More on using GraphLayouts later
below.<p>

What all this means is that if you want your Nodes to be displayed
they must implement the DrawableNonGridNode interface and your Edges
must implement the DrawableEdge interface. Rather than having you
implement the DrawableNonGridNode interface, Repast provides the 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/DefaultDrawableNode.html">DefaultDrawableNode</a>
class. This class extends DefaultNode, so it contains all the network
functionality described above; it is a DefaultNode. And it implements
DrawableNonGridNode so it can be drawn with a Network2DDisplay. The
actual drawing (as a rectangle, oval or whatever) of a DefaultDrawableNode
is handled by a 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/NetworkDrawable.html">NetworkDrawable</a>.
Repast provide two sorts of NetworkDrawables: a
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/OvalNetworkItem.html">OvalNetworkItem</a>,
and a 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/RectNetworkItem.html">RectNetworkItem</a>.
These will draw your DefaultDrawableNodes as ovals or rectangles respectively.
<p>

While this mixture of DefaultNodes, DefaultDrawableNodes, and
NetworkDrawables sounds quite complicated, in practice just a few
lines of code are erequired to create nodes capable of being drawn by
a Network2DDisplay and laid out by a GraphLayout. For example,

<code><pre>
OvalNetworkItem item = new OvalNetworkItem(1, 10);
DefaultDrawableNode node = new DefaultDrawableNode(item);
</pre></code>

The first line creates an OvalNetworkItem with x and y coordinates of
1 and 10. The second line creates a DefaultDrawableNode and passes the
OvalNetworkItem as part of the constructor. This means that the
DefaultDrawableNode will be drawn as an oval. Moreover, once you've
passed the OvalNetworkItem in this way, you needn't worry about it
again. In addition to the above, you can also set the NetworkDrawable for
a DefaultDrawableNode with DefaultDrawableNode's setDrawable method. 
This allows you to easily change the shape etc. of the node while the model
is running.<p>

The above is a simple example of how NetworkDrawables (OvalNetworkItems etc.)
and DefaultDrawableNodes work together. Typically, you would create your
own agent class that extends DefaultDrawableNode and then set the 
NetworkDrawable on that. Both the demonstration network models, 
jiggle (repast/demo/jiggle) and jinGirNew (repast/demo/jinGirNew) work
in this way.<p>

As mentioned above, your Edges must implement the DrawableEdge
interface. Repast provides a default implementation of this that should
be fine for most purposes. See, 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/DefaultDrawableEdge.html">DefaultDrawableEdge</a>
for more info. Edge directionality is indicated by a small square on
the displayed edge. The square is closer to the "to" node and farther from
the "from" node. If the nodes are too close to each other to determine
directionality, you can use the mouse (click and drag) to move the
nodes further away. In addition, EdgeFactory has methods for automating
the creation and linking of Nodes using DefaultDrawableEdges. 
<p>

Once you have constructed a Network2DDisplay it is handled like any
other display. See <a href="./display.html">How to Create Displays</a>
for more information.
<p>

The Network2DDisplay will layout DrawableNonGridNodes according to
their x, y coordinates, and is not itself capable of doing any sort of
graph layout.  As mentioned above, you can use one of the graph layout
classes to lay out your network for you. For example,

<code><pre>
layout = new CircularLayout(agentList, xSize, ySize);
Network2DDisplay display = new Network2DDisplay(layout);
surface.addDisplayableProbeable(display, "Network Display");
</pre></code>

This constructs a CircularGraphLayout by passing it the list of 
agents (most likely a list of DefaultDrawableNodes) and the size
of the display. This layout is then passed to Network2DDisplay and
that display is then handled in the usual manner.  See 
<a href="./display.html">How to Create Displays</a> for more information.
If the included graph layouts are not sufficient you can create 
your own using 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/AbstractGraphLayout.html">AbstractGraphLayout</a>
as a base class.<p>

Graph layouts do not update themselves automatically every tick. You
will need to schedule the updateLayout() method on your graph layout
in order to update the layout. See 
<a href="./scheduler.html">How to Use a Schedule</a> for more info.  
FruchGraphLayout and KamadaGraphLayout calculate node coordinates
based on edge connections, so whenever these connections change then
updateLayout() will create a new layout. Conversely, the
CircularGraphLayout will create the same layout regardeless of the
structure of the network, and updateLayout() will only need to be
called if the model itself changes the coordinates of the
nodes.<p> 

FruchGraphLayout and KamadaGraphLayout can be quite slow when laying
out large networks. Consequently, you may want to update the layout
infrequently. These two classes also have "hooks" in them to react to
Repast toolbar (the bar with the start, stop, etc. buttons) button
presses. This allows you to interrupt the layout by pressing stop,
pause, or exit. Without this, your model may continue to finish
network layout even though you have pressed pause.  You can attach the
layout to the toolbar buttons as follows:

<code><pre>
Controller c = (Controller)getController();
c.addStopListener(graphLayout);
c.addPauseListener(graphLayout);
c.addExitListener(graphLayout);
</pre></code>

This code would typically be placed in your model's buildDisplay() 
method.<p>


You can also move the nodes around with the mouse by clicking on a
node and dragging it. This is useful if the nodes are obscuring each
other.  Zooming in on parts of the network is also posssible. You do
this by holding down the control-key and dragging the mouse to draw a
box around the area you wish to zoom in on. After you've defined the
zoom area, press the "z" key to zoom. Press "r" to return the network
to its normal state.
<p>

<a name="io">
<b>Importing and Exporting Network Data</b><br>
Repast provides facilities for importing and exporting network data.<p>

<b>Importing Data</b><br>
Network data is imported via the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a> class.
Using NetworkFactory.getNetwork method, you can import a network
from two file formats. The file description of the network is 
transformed into a list of Nodes and Edges of some user specified
type. The supported formats are UCINet's dl format and the UCINet
compatible Excel format.<p>

The matrix is assumed to be square for both the dl and Excel formats.
For Excel, each worksheet is treated as a matrix, and any worksheets
that do not contain matrices will cause an error. The worksheet name
is treated as the matrix label unless the name begins with Sheet
(Excel's generic worksheet name). The format for excel files is that
imported and exported by UCINet. The first cell is empty, and the
node labels begin on this first row in the second column. The column
node labels begin in first column on the second row. The actual data
begins in cell 2,2. For example,
<code><pre>
             | first_label | second_label | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
first_label  | 0           | 1            | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
second_label | 1           | 0            | ...
-------------+-------------+--------------+----
...          | ...         | ...          | ...
</pre></code>
If the matrix has no node labels, Repast will expect the first row and
column to be blank and for the data to begin in cell 2,2.<p>

An example,
<code><pre>
List list = NetworkFactory.getNetwork("./network.dl", NetworkFactory.DL,
                                     MyNode.class, MyEdge.class,
                                     NetworkFactory.BINARY);
</pre></code>
NetworkFactory will parse the network.dl file creating a list of
Nodes that contain the appropriate Edges to other Nodes. In this case,
all the nodes will be of the MyNode class and the edges of MyEdge class.
This assumes you have defined a MyNode class that implements the
Node interface and have defined a MyEdge class that implements the
Edge interface. DefaultNode.class and DefaultEdge.class could have
been substituted here as well. (The "ClassName.class" notation returns 
class information about a class.) The resulting List can be used just
as if you had created the network by hand (as in the previous example).
The final argument specifies the size of the matrix cell items (ij values). 
It can be one of NetworkFactory.BINARY, NetworkFactory.SMALL, or
NetworkFactory.LARGE. Use BINARY if the ij values are 0 or 1, SMALL if
the values are between -127 and 127 and LARGE for anything else. The 
difference in memory usage between BINARY and LARGE is enormous and 
specifying BINARY here can make the difference between being able or
unable to actually import a network into Repast.
<p>

<b>Note</b>: The Excel format can only be used on windows and
requires that you copy the ExcelAccessor.dll from
repast/lib to your system folder (i.e. windows/system or
winnt/system32).<p>

<b>Exporting Data</b><br>
Exporting data is done through the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkRecorder.html">NetworkRecorder</a> class. NetworkRecorder records a network as a matrix or 
matrices in the appropriate format. It takes a list of Nodes and 
writes the corresponding adjacency matrix to a file. Three file formats 
are supported: UCINet's dl, Excel, and ASCII. The actual network 
matrix is written out in this format, although Repast records relevant 
non-matrix information as well:
a file header containing the constant parameters for the model and a
timestamp, and a block header that contains header information relevant
to the network data recorded beneath it. The block header will contain
the value of any dynamic model parameters at the time a network
was recorded, as well as any user comments (typically the current tick
count).<p>

The actual format of the file is as follows:
<code><pre>
file header

block_header_1
network data in the specified format

block_header_2
network data in the specified format
...
</pre></code>

Specifying the format then specifies the format for the network data. The
rest (file header and block header) will remain the same for all formats.
The actual network data can easily be cut and pasted out of the file.<p>

ASCII format will record the matrix and the matrix label in comma
delimited plain text. Excel format will store it in an Excel file
in a format suitable for importation into UCINet.<p>

<b>Note</b>: Excel format should not be used as it is very time consuming
and error prone to write to an Excel file. Use ASCII instead which
is a plain text format suitable for importation into excel.<p>

An example,
<code><pre>
NetworkRecorder recorder = new NetworkRecorder(NetworkRecorder.DL,
                                              "./myNetwork.dl",
					      this);
...

recorder.record(nodeList, "tick: " + getTickCount(), NetworkRecorder.BINARY);
...
recorder.write();
</pre></code>
The first line creates a NetworkRecorder to record a network in
dl format into the file myNetwork.dl, and passes it a reference to the
model in which the recorder is constructed. The second line
does the actual recording. It records the network(s) represented by the
Nodes and their Edges in nodeList and appends the current tick count
to the block header. The last argument refers to the size of the 
ij values, and works the same as for NetworkFactory.getNetwork (see above).
The ij value recorded is that of the strength of the edge. By default
this is 1 if an edge exists otherwise 0. recorder.record(..) should occur 
as part of a BasicAction to be scheduled for some sort of repeated execution.
recorder.write() does the actual write of the data record by 
recored.record to the specified file (e.g. myNetwork.dl). Writing
to disk is slow and so the call to recorder.write() should be done
sporadically.
See <a href="./data.html">How to Collect Data</a> from more on 
scheduling data collection.<p>

<a name="create">
<b>Predefined Network Structures</b><br>
In addtion to being used to import networks from a file,
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a> 
can also be used to create some common network structures. These are:
a Square Lattice Network, a Random Density Network, and the classic
Watts-Strogatz small world network (ring substrate). You create these
networks using the appropriate methods in NetworkFactory. They operate
similar to importing data. You provide the node and edge classes, as
well as some network parameters, and you get back a network of the 
appropriate structure as a List of your node classes See
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/network/NetworkFactory.html">NetworkFactory</a>
for more info.
