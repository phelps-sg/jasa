<h1>
<center>How to Collect Data</center> </h1><p> Data collection is
handled primarily through the 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/DataRecorder.html">DataRecorder</a>
object which can record data from a variety of sources and write that
data out in tabular format to a file.  The Enn (Endogenous
Neighborhood) demonstration simulation (in repast/demo/enn) has a good
example of how to use a DataRecorder object and should be explored in
conjunction with this document. In addition to the DataRecorder class,
some other options for data collection are described at the end of
this document.
<p>
Using a DataRecorder is a matter of creating it, adding data sources to it, and
then scheduling records and file writes. The following is an example of
creating the DataRecorder variable recorder. 
Creating a DataRecorder looks like:<p>
<code>
recorder = new DataRecorder("./data.txt", this);
</code>
<p>
or to add an optional header comment to the output file:
<p>
<code>
recorder = new DataRecorder("./data.txt", this, "A Comment");
</code>
<p>

The first argument is the name of the file to write the data out to, the 
second is the model associated with the recorder (and so the argument is
"this" given that the recorder is created within the model). In the
second example, the final argument is an optional header comment. 
Once constructed the DataRecorder queries the model to determine if
the simulation is running in batch mode. If so, the data recorder 
will write all the data to a single file keeping track of the run 
number and so forth.<p>

Creating and adding data sources to the DataRecorder tells the 
DataRecorder where to find the data to record. The DataRecorder will record 
the data from these sources when it is sent the record() message, 
usually by the scheduling mechanism. The source of data for DataRecorder 
is typically a method call on some object, or the value of some instance 
variable. The actual sources for data can be of two types: numbers
(ints, floats, longs, doubles) and objects (Strings etc.). 
<p>

In order for the DataRecorder to know how to work with the wide variety
of possible data sources, these method calls or instance variables must
be wrapped in one of two interfaces - NumericDataSource or DataSource,
where NumericDataSource is for numeric datasources and DataSource is for
anything else. The <code>NumericDataSource</code> interface has a
single method: <code>public double execute()</code>, and the
<code>DataSource</code> interface also has a single method:
<code>public Object execute()</code>. Wrapping your data source in
one of these interfaces entails creating a class that implements
one of the above interfaces and returning the data you wish to record
from the execute method. Like BasicActions, you can create these 
classes by hand or have Repast dynamically create them for you. An
example follows:

<code><pre>
public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  private int numAgents;
  private Space space;
  private DataRecorder recorder;

  ...

  class NumDataSource implements NumericDataSouce {
    public double execute() {
      return numAgents;
    }
  }

  class ObjDataSource implements DataSource {
    public Object execute() {
      return space.getData();
    }
  }

  private void buildModel() {
    recorder = new DataRecorder("./data.txt", this);
    recorder.addNumericDataSource("numAgents", new NumDataSource());
    recorder.addObjectDataSource("SpaceData", new ObjDataSource());
    ...
  }
}
</pre></code>

Here, we have implemented two data sources as inner classes to our 
model. The first, NumDataSource, merely returns the value of the
numAgents ivar. The second, ObjDataSource, calls a method on 
some hypothetical Space object that returns an Object for recording.
We then add these DataSources to the recorder in the buildModel()
method. Having added the DataSources, the execute() methods of these
DataSources will be called whenever we call DataRecorder.record(). (You could
also use anonymous inner classes here in place of teh explicit inner
classes ObjectDataSource and NumDataSource.)
<p>

If you wish Repast to create a class that implements one of these
interfaces for you, the code looks like:

<code><pre>
public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {

  private int numAgents;
  private Space space;
  private DataRecorder recorder;
  ...

  public int getNumAgents() {
    return numAgents;
  }

  public String getSpaceData() {
    return space.getData();
  }


  private void buildModel() {
    recorder = new DataRecorder("./data.txt", this);
    recorder.createNumericDataSource("numAgents", this, "getNumAgents");
    recorder.createObjectDataSource("SpaceData", this, "getSpaceData");
    ...
  }
}
</pre></code>

Here, we create the DataSources and add them with method calls to the
DataRecorder object. The create* methods of the DataRecorder takes a
label for the data to be recorded, an object reference, and the name
of the method to call on that object that will return the data. So, in
the above, Repast creates a NumericDataSource object whose execute
method calls getNumAgents(). The createObjectDataSource works in a
similar way. The results of either method of creating DataSources, by
hand or dynamically, are comparable. However, with dynamic creation
such errors as mis-spelling the method name argument in the create*
call will not be caught until runtime.
<p>

For NumericDataSources you can also specify the number of digits
both before and after the decimal point that you wish to record. So
for example, <code>recorder.createNumericDataSource("numAgents", 
this, "getNumAgents", 3, 4)</code> will record 3 digits before the
decimal point and 4 after. If the DataSource produces 3333.22222222,
the value 333.2222 will be recorded. An argument of -1 will record
all the digits, so  <code>recorder.createNumericDataSource("numAgents", 
this, "getNumAgents", -1, 4)</code> will record 3333.2222. Note that
the number is not truncated, but rounded according to standard rules
for rounding floating point numbers. See the API 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/DataRecorder.html">documentation</a>
for more info on the DataRecorder class.
<p>

The actual data collection via the record() method and writes of the
recorded data to a file via writeToFile() are scheduled just 
like any other methods to be scheduled. For example,

<code><pre>
schedule.scheduleActionBeginning(0, new BasicAction() {
  public void execute() {
    dRecorder.record();
  }
});

schedule.scheduleActionAtEnd(dRecorder, "writeToFile");
</pre></code>

tells the scheduling mechanism to call the record() method on the
DataRecorder variable dRecorder every tick beginning at 0. As
mentioned above dRecorder then queries its data sources in the manner
described above and records the result.  The above also tells the
scheduling mechanism to call the "writeToFile" method on
dRecorder. dRecorder then writes the collected data to the file
specified when the dRecorder was constructed, appending the data if
data has already been written during this run. The output file begins
with a header giving model parameters for this run, followed by the
data in tabular format.  For example
<p>
<code>
RngSeed: 948816295132<br>
numAgents: 100<br>
maxAge: 120<br>
<br>
"tick","Avg. Age"<br>
0.0,33<br>
1.0,33<br>
2.0,32<br>
3.0,40<br>
...
</code><p>
The output file in a batch run is slightly different. There, any constant
parameters are recorded in the header as is the starting time of the batch run.
Any dynamic parameters as defined in the batch parameter file are recorded 
in the body of the table.<p>
 
You can also change the delimiter for the recorded
data with the <tt>setDelimiter(String val)</tt> method. The default 
delimiter is "," and so by default recorded data will look something like 
that above. Changing the delimimter to a ":" for example, will result in:
<p>
<code>
RngSeed: 948816295132<br>
numAgents: 100<br>
maxAge: 120<br>
<br>
"tick":"Avg. Age"<br>
0.0:33<br>
1.0:33<br>
2.0:32<br>
3.0:40<br>
...
</code><p>

<b>Note</b> that data is stored in memory until the writeToFile call
at which point it is flushed. If you are experiencing memory problems,
write your data to a file more frequently.
<p>

<b>Additional Ways to Collect Data</b><br>
In addition to the DataRecorder there are several other options for
recording data from a Repast simluation. For the ways to record
network data, see <a href="./network.html">Network Models</a>.
Recording data via an 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/ObjectDataRecorder.html">ObjectDataRecorder</a>
is described below.<p>

An ObjectDataRecorder records arbitrary objects to files as Strings
together with an optional comment. Typically, this comment will be the 
tick count, but need not be. An ObjectDataRecorder is constructed
much like a DataRecorder object with a fileName and associated
model. Unlike a DataRecorder an ObjectDataRecorder has no data sources, and
records an arbitrary object when instructed to do so via its
record() method.<p>

In non-batch mode, a file header will be written that includes all the
model's properties and the values of these properties. These values
will be the value at the time the first call to write is made, allowing the
user to manipulate the parameters after setting up but prior to running the
model. Consequently, your initial model parameters should only be
changeable via the user or through a parameter file. If not, the file header
may be inaccurate. The actual data will be written as a block where the
block includes the optional comment as a header, followed by the String
representation of the object itself. This String representation is
acquired via the object's toString() method.<p>

In batch mode, any constant model parameters will be written in the
file header. The data block will include the value of any dynamic
parameters, the run number, as well as the optional comment (again,
typically the tick count), together with the String representation of the
Object to be recorded.<p>

Data is recorded by an ObjectDataRecorder via its record() method and 
written to a file via its write() method. See the API
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/analysis/ObjectDataRecorder.html">docs</a>
for more information.
