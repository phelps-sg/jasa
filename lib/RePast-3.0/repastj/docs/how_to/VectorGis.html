			<center>How to Use Vector GIS</center>
		</h1>
		<p>
			Several packages have been used to add vector gis support to Repast. These are 
			most notably <a href="http://www.geotools.org">Geotools</a> and <a href="http://www.vividsolution.com/jts/main.htm">
				Java Topology Suite</a> These provide the back and middle end support for 
			the types of operations needed for gis. JTS implements the Simple Features 
			Specification from the OpenGis Consortium, and Geotools provides data handling 
			(the full geotools package includes much more). Repast's gis tools are 
			basically adapters between these toolkits and the Repast toolkit.
		</p>
		<P>
			<b>Gis Philosophy</b>
		These adapters take the philosophy that gis features can be represented as 
		pieces of a network. A Point can be represented as a node, a polygon can be 
		represented as a node and a linestring can be represented as an edge. So each 
		of these feature types (as well as its "multi" counterpart) have the methods 
		from those types in Repast as well as the basic geographic functions.
		<P>
			<b>Use</b> In order to create a gis space in Repast, you need to create a 
			Geotools datasource. There are several including shapefile, postgis, and gml. 
			More are being added daily. For an updated view on what's available check out 
			the <a href="www.geotools.org">Geotools website</a>
		. The simplest one is the ShapefileDataSource. To create one, you just need a 
		shape file. It can either be a set of individual files or a zip file.
		<P>
		So:
		<P>
			<code>
				<pre>
				ShapefileDataSource = new ShapefileDataSource(new 
				URL("file:///home/thowe/data/tomszips"); </code></pre> This would create a 
			DataSource from the directory:
			<pre>
/home
	/thowe
		/data
			tomszips.shp
			tomszips.dbf
			tomszips.shx

or

/home
	/thowe
		/data
			tomszips.zip
</pre>
		<P>
		Once you have the datasource, use the DataSourceHandler to extract the 
		features.
		<P>
			<code>
				<pre>
				Feature[] f = ShapeFileHandler.getFeatures(datasource); </code>
		</pre>
		<P>
		You then create RepastGisFeatures from these. Each of the features has a 
		constructor for Feature, so it's quite easy:
		<P>
			<code>
				<pre>
				DrawablePolygon p = new DrawablePolygon(f[0]); </code>
		</pre> The next step is to add these features to a GisLayer. This is very 
		similar to a layer in other gis contexts. It is a set of features which are 
		connected (semantically, not necessarily physically).
		<P>
			<code>
				<pre>
				GisLayer layer = new GisLayer(LayerType.POLYGON); layer.add(p); </code>
		</pre>
		<P>
		At this point you have a complete layer of features. At this point, you could 
		either just work with the data as it is, or add things such as neighborhooders. 
		This allows you to easily solve the nearest neighbor problem. At the moment, 
		the only neighborhooder we have for gis is Delaunay Triangulation, but others 
		will follow. Of course, you could also use distance between features to solve 
		the nearest neighbor problem.
		<P>
			<b>Display</b>
		<P>
			To display vector gis, you need to create a GisDisplay and add Displayable 
			features to it. <code>
				<pre>
				GisDisplay display = new GisDisplay(300); display.addLayer(layer); </code>
		</pre> At this point, your display works just like any other Repast Display. 
		Note that the constructor for GisDisplay only takes one Argument. This is 
		because the y value for the size is scaled based on the x value.
