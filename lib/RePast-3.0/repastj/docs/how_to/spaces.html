			Spaces in Repast serve two purposes. They can be the basis for "spatial agents" 
			such as the SugarSpace or the InfiniteLifeSpace in the SugarScape and Life 
			demonstration models. And they also function as a collection of agents that 
			define the spatial relationship of agents relative to each other.<p>
				Repast offers the following spaces. See the API docs (click the links) for more 
				information. Note that Network spaces are quite different and are covered in 
				the <a href="./network.html">Network Models</a> document.

			(Note that in the above, hexagonal refers to the shape of the cells, such that 
			in a hexagonal grid or torus each cell is hexagonal and thus has six 
			neighbors.)<p>
			These spaces contain methods for inserting and removing items via the 
			applicable coordinates. They also contain methods for retrieving a list of 
			items in neighboring cells (Von Neumann or Moore neighborhood in the case of 
			non-hexagonal spaces and neighborhood "rings" for hexagonal) as well as for 
			determining the minimum or maximum item in such a neighborhood. What 
			constitutes minimum and maximum can be user-defined.<p>
				Using a space as a spatial collection of agents is fairly simple and is 
				typically a matter of inserting and removing agents from the space, and perhaps 
				querying the space for an agent's neighbors. The typical pattern is that all 
				agents in a particular space have an instance variable reference to that space. 
				So for example, in the buildModel method in your model, you'd have something 
				like: <code>
					<pre>
Object2DGrid space = new Object2DGrid(spaceWidth, spaceHeight);
for (int i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {
  int x, y;
  do {
    x = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, space.getSizeX() - 1);
    y = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, space.getSizeY() - 1);
  } while (space.getObjectAt(x, y) != null);

  MyAgent agent = new MyAgent(x, y, space);
  space.putObjectAt(x, y, agent);
  agentList.add(agent);
}
</pre>
				</code>
			The first line here creates an Object2DGrid space. It then creates some number 
			of agents of MyAgent type. The do loop gets random x and y coordinates and 
			keeps getting new coordinates if the cell in the space at those coordinates is 
			full. The agent is then created, given those coordinates and a reference to the 
			space, and added to the space at those coordinates. (Note that if you were 
			using one of the Multi spaces, you wouldn't need to check if the space cell was 
			occupied as more than one agent can occupy a cell in those spaces.)<p>
				Regardless of what sort of space you use, this pattern is typical. The agent 
				has a reference to the space, and knows its own x and y coordinates and the 
				space contains the agent. Agent movement is a matter of changing the agent's 
				internal x and y coordinates, removing it from its previously occupied cell and 
				adding it to the new one. For example, <code>
					<pre>
space.putObjectAt(x, y, null);
x = newX;
y = newY;
space.putObjectAt(x, y, this);
</pre>
				</code>
			As we see here removing an agent from a space cell is accomplished by setting 
			that cell's occupant to null. This code takes place within the agent and thus 
			we use the "this" reference to the current agent to place that agent in the new 
			cell. newX and newY have been set outside our code snippet and no check that 
			the new cell is occupied is done here. Note that the pattern (set to null for 
			remove etc.) for working with Multi spaces is the space, although the exact 
			methods will be different. See the API docs for details.
