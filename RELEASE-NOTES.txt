  Change log for JASA 1.0 - 13th January 2011
  
Changes since release 0.36:
  
This release is a major redesign.  JASA now sits on top of the 
JABM framework; see:

http://jabm.sourceforge.net/

which allows configuration via the Spring framework instead of 
ECJ's property-based framework.

Additionally, JASA has been redesigned so that it supports agent-based
models of financial markets which allow agents to hold multiple
buy and sell positions.
